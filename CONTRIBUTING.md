## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related issues.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Perform a search** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Check if the issue has been fixed**—try to reproduce it using the latest branch in the repository.

#### How Do I Submit A Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/yourusername/zomagle/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
- **Describe the exact steps** which reproduce the problem.
- **Explain the behavior** you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Describe the behavior** you expected to see instead and why.
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Perform a search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Check if the enhancement is already implemented**—try to see if it's already part of the latest branch in the repository.

#### How Do I Submit An Enhancement Suggestion?

- **Write clear, concise commit messages**.
- **Follow the style guidelines**.
- **Test your code thoroughly**.

#### How Do I Submit A Pull Request?

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you’ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you’ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript must adhere to the following rules:

- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- Prefer arrow functions for anonymous functions.
- Use template literals (` `` `) instead of string concatenation.
- Always use strict equality (`===`) unless you need type coercion.
- Use single quotes for strings, except to avoid escaping.
- Place `React` component methods in the following order: lifecycle methods, event handlers, render method.
- Ensure all files end with a newline.
